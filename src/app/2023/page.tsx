        As the clock strikes midnight EST (UTC-5), a new puzzle emerges,
        challenging my coding prowess. While I aim to swiftly conquer each
        puzzle, I can't make promises on the timing of my solutions. However,
        rest assured, once I crack the code, a detailed blog post will follow,
        unraveling the intricacies of the day's challenge.

        To streamline my approach, I've crafted a template for this year's
        journey. This template, designed to expedite the initial setup,
        leverages the Bun runtime for seamless Typescript support. By automating
        the loading and parsing of input files, I can direct my focus squarely
        on the puzzle at hand.

      <p>
        For those intrigued by the inner workings, the template is available on

        . Feel free to explore and utilize it as you embark on your own coding
        adventures.{" "}

        At the heart of the template lies a switch â€“ a constant in the setup
        file allowing seamless toggling between the test input and the actual
        challenge input. The test input, a smaller subset for trial and error,
        aids in refining solutions before applying them to the real challenge
        input.
